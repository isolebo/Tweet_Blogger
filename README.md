# Design Objective
 Intended to build a platform that allows  the functionality of a modern app where a visitor to the site can perform certain
 functions to manage an application.
 
 
 # Functionality
In this project:

* A visitor can create or log in to an account.
* The user can add a new tweet post to the account or reply to a previous tweet.
* In addition, a visitor can access a list of Users, Tweets, and Replies that was made.


#  Design Principles
I used React-Redux with hooks for my implementation of the project for my frontend, and used 
json-server for my backend.

* React.js
* Redux
* `json-server `

# Structure

This project focuses on the implementation of using React with Redux in functional components. I chose
Redux because managing state values was easier.

* frontend/: The files contained in this folder are my React.js files, Redux, and Axios based API cals

* Server.js: I chose `json-server` as my backend.
